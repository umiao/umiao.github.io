The DB can be generally divided into: Relational DB NoSQL DB (e.g., KV (key-value) based DB) Recommended code style of SQL (Structed Query Language): Capitalize all keywords and reserved words, and lowercase all other contents. Each statement should end with ;. Keywords and Syntax RulesThe query syntax SHOW DATABASES 1SHOW DATABASES; List all the names of exisitng databases (under the current schema). USE 1234USE database_name;SELECT * from table;SELECT * from database_name.table; -- Must specify the database_name for the DBs which are not in use Select one DB as the default one. SELECT 1SELECT (column_name) FROM (table_name) WHERE (condition) ORDER BY (col_name). Select the desired data from a table. It should be noted that you should use &#x3D; in SQL to determine equivalence. (It DOES NOT mean assignment.) You can conduct calculation on the selected result. AS 1SELECT (column_name) FROM (table_name) WHERE (condition) ORDER BY (col_name). For each col_name, table_name to be queried and the queried results, you can always to set alias (surname) for them with AS. – &#x2F; comment 12-- This a comment.// This is also acceptable. DISTINCT 1SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM t Add DISTINCT ahead of the queried target (column) to receive all the unique values. AND &#x2F; OR &#x2F; NOT 1SELECT * FROM t WHERE col_a &gt; 10 and col_b = &#x27;CA&#x27; Logical operator to be used with the WHERE clause. IN 1SELECT * FROM t WHERE col_a IN (&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;) Determine if the queried value belongs to a set. BETWEEN 123SELECT * FROM t WHERE point BETWEEN 100 AND 300;SELECT * FROM t WHERE point &gt;= 100 AND point &lt;= 300;-- These two are equivalent Determine if the queried value within a given interval. Both ends of the interval are closed ([beg, end]). LIKE 12SELECT * FROM t WHERE name like &#x27;b%&#x27;-- Able to match &#x27;Bob&#x27; and &#x27;bike&#x27; Provide functionality similar to Regular Expression. % can match arbitrary string, _ can match arbitrary char. Not sensitive to the case. REGEXP 1SELECT * FROM t WHERE name REGEX &#x27;^f[a-z]+d&#x27; Match a given Regular Expression pattern. IS NULL 12SELECT * FROM t WHERE name IS NULL;SELECT * FROM t WHERE name IS NOT NULL; Query all the records which are (not) null in a given column. ORDER BY 1SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY col_name DESC / AESC Decide the sorting order of the returned records. LIMIT 12SELECT * FROM t LIMIT offset, tot_numSELECT * FROM t LIMIT tot_num Restrict the number of the returned records. Skip the first $n&#x3D;$offset records and then return tot_num lines of records. Return all the records if number of matched records fewer than tot_num. INNER JOIN 123SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b on t_a.col_1 = t_b.col_2;SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b on t_a.col_1 = DB_2.t_b.col_2;-- You can conduct crossed-DB join by specifying the name of the DB not in use. Can be simply writtene as JOIN. Concat two tables based on the given condition. Conduct Cartesian product implicitly. SELF JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a AS a JOIN t_a AS b on a.col_1 = b.col_2; A table can join with itself, but different alias are required. Multi-table JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b on a.col_1 = b.col_2 JOIN t_c on b.col_2 = c.col_3; Multiple (n) tables can be joined but this is not recommended when $ n &gt; 3 $ due to performance concern. Composite JOIN &#x2F; Implicit JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b on a.col_1 = b.col_2 JOIN t_c on b.col_2 = c.col_3; Sometimes only a tuple of multiple attributes can uniquely identify a row of the table. In this case, these attributes become Composite Primary Key. 1SELECT * FROM t_a, t_b; Implicit JOIN is conducted in the above example but this is not recommended, too. OUTER JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a AS a JOIN t_b AS b on a.col_1 = b.col_2 JOIN t_c AS c on b.col_2 = c.col_3; When using INNER JOIN, some records of the left table cannot match with the right table because the condition of the ON clause is not satisfied. However, if we want to return all the records of the left (right) table regardless of the boolean value of the ON clause, we can use LEFT (RIGHT) OUTER JOIN. You should use RIGHT JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN as possible. SELF OUTER JOIN is similar, and alias is still required. USING 123SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b on t_a.col_1 = t_b.col_1;SELECT * FROM t_a JOIN t_b USING (col_1);-- These two are equivalent. Can be used to simplify the code, if the column names of the to-be-joined tables are exactly the same. You can Join on a tuple like ‘USING (id1, id2, id3)’ and these column names should be exactly the same as well (in the two tables). NATURAL JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a NATURAL JOIN t_b; Let the compiler (DBMS) to decide the way of join. Not recommended to use! CROSS JOIN 1SELECT * FROM t_a CROSS JOIN t_b; Conduct Cartesian Product. UNION 1SELECT * FROM a UNION SELECT * FROM b; Concatenate multiple queried results together (on the direction of row). The column names should be exactly the same. IT SHOULD BE NOTED that ORDER BY can be set only once, so union all the results before setting the ORDER clause. The update &#x2F; delete &#x2F; insert syntax The column attributes of table: PK： primary key NN： Not Null UQ：Unique Index B： binary UN： unsigned data type ZF： zero filled AI： Auto incremental G： Generated column Data Type in MySQL: INT (11): integer with a length of 11 VARCHAR(50): array of char with a size $\\le 50$. CHAR(50): array of char with a size $&#x3D; 50$. DEFAULT: Use the given default value to fill this column. Insert data to table: 1INSERT INTO customers VALUES (DEFAULT, ‘John’, ‘Smith’, ‘1990-01-01’, NULL, ‘address’, ‘city’, ‘CA’, DEFAULT); At the same time, MySQL allows to specify the column names to be assigned values. 1INSERT INTO customers (first_name, …, state, points) VALUES (…); In this case, you do not need to assign the values to the order (of columns) defined by the table. The number of affected rows would be returned after successful insertion. Insert Multi-rows: 1INSERT INTO shippers (name) VALUES (&#x27;S1&#x27;), (&#x27;S2&#x27;), (&#x27;S3&#x27;); LAST_INSERT_ID: Returns the most recently generated Auto Incremental ID. Enable hierarchical data insertion. I.E., find the ID of the latest inserted data, and then use the id to associate &#x2F; update other tables. This syntax feature can eliminate ambiguity, and it is also convenient to correspond a main table record to multiple sub table records. Duplicate Table: 1CREATE TABLE orders_archived AS SELECT * FROM orders; Use the selected partial &#x2F; entire data of other table to create a duplicate. However, column attributes (constraints) like PK, AI would be ignored. Batch Insertion with Select: 1INSERT INTO orders_archived SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date &lt; ’2019-01-01’; Column attributes (constraints) like PK, AI would be ignored as well. Truncate Table in workbench: Right click a table and select ‘truncate table’ would remove all the data (records) but would not remove the table itself. Update a single row: 1UPDATE invoices SET payment_total = 10, payment_date=’2019-03-01’ WHERE invoice_id = 1; Filter the results (single line) that meet the conditions and update the filtered results. It is also allowed to use default, arithmetic expression, etc. as the new value of the selected row. Note that even if multiple statements are selected for your filter criteria, MySQL workbench runs in the security update mode by default, allowing you to update only one row at a time. However, in other environments, there is no such problem. You can drag it to the bottom of SQL editor and choose to uncheck the safe updates option. After changing the settings, you need to reconnect for the settings to take effect. WHERE attribute IN (1,2,3) can be used to filter multiple records. Use SELECT to UPDATE (apply sub-query in UPDATE): 1UPDATE invoices SET payment_total = 10, payment_date=’2019-03-01’ WHERE client_id = ( SELECT client_id FROM clients WHERE name=’Myworks’ ); In this manner, a single logical judgement is replaced with a sub-query to update multiple values at a time. If multiple values would be returned in your sub-query, the WHERE clause should be changed to WHERE client_id IN (sub-query). You should test the sub-query before update the table. You CANNOT update the same table where you conduct your sub-query —- If you have to do so, create a duplicate and give it an alias. DELETE: 1DELETE FROM invoices WHERE (invoice_id=1); Obviously, the condition within the parenthesis can be a sub-query, too. Rebuild the Database: 12DROP DB If EXISTS DB;-- Conduct the script of DB building then. Function and the Aggregate Function Aggregate Function: 1COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(), SUM() It should be noted that COUNT(row_name) only returns the number of the non-empty records. If you need to find out the total number of rows, you shoud use COUNT(*). You can use COUNT (DISTINCT client_id) to find out the number of unique client_id, too. Non-Aggregate Function: 1234RAND() -- Generate a random number within (0, 1)RAND(seed) -- Specify the rand seedSQRT() -- Find the square root for each valueCONCAT(a, b) -- Concat two strings into one Non-aggregate function would return a same-lengthed sequence for the input values. These functions are element-wised. GROUP BY clause: Group the rows according to a given column name. Rows with the same value in the very column would be aggregated together. The order of query clause: IMPORTANT: SELECT -&gt; FROM -&gt; WHERE -&gt; ORDER BY Grouping based on multiple attributes: 1GROUP BY state, city In this case, the grouping would based on the tuple: (state, city) Having: 1SELECT SUM(res) AS aggregated_res FROM t GROUP BY state HAVING aggregated_res &gt; 100; You cannot use WHERE clause to filter the result of the aggreate function, because at that time, the query is not yet completed and the aggregate result is not yet calculated. It should be noted that HAVING clause supports the filtering on Composite Condition, e.g. HAVING aggre_res1 &gt; 10 AND aggre_res2 &lt; 10. The HAVING clause is execute after the query is finished. So that it can only filter the selected columns. The columns not selected cannot be used in the filtering constraint. HAVING does NOT support alias. WITH ROLLUP: 1SELECT SUM(res) AS aggregated_res FROM t GROUP BY state HAVING aggregated_res &gt; 100; Conduct an extra aggregate operation for all the aggregated results. E.g., the SUM &#x2F; MEAN of the aggregated results. This is only supported by MySQL. If composite grouping is applied, e.g., GROUP BY col_a, col_b, each group identified by a unique (col_a, col_b) would conduct an extra aggregation. Nesting Sub-query: 12SELECT * FROM (SELECT ...);SELECT * FROM table WHERE col_name IN / NOT IN (SELECT ...); I.E., select from the result of another select operation. ALL VS ANY &#x2F; SOME 1234SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE invoice_total &gt; ALL(SELECT invoice_total FROM invoices WHERE client_id = 3);-- Require the records to be greater than ANY of the sub-query results in order to be selectedSELECT * FROM invoices WHERE invoice_total &gt; ANY / SOME(SELECT invoice_total FROM invoices WHERE client_id = 3);-- Require the records to be greater than ONE of the sub-query results in order to be selected ANY &#x2F; SOME are completely equivalent. If one value of the sub-query satisfies the logical expression, the ‘&gt; ANY’ expression is satisfied. For ALL, only if all the values of the sub-query satisfies the logical expression, the ‘&gt; ALL’ expression can be satisfied. ‘&#x3D; ANY’ also equals to ‘IN’. Correlated sub-query Code-writing Order: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY Executing Order: FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY The marked line is crucial, as the logic of correlated subquery would retrive one value from the main query at a time, working in an iterative manner, input the value into the sub-query to ge the result and pass the result back to the main query. The main query would check the constraint of WHERE clause and return the result; This means that different alias are required even they points to the same table. Sub-query can touch the alias of the main &#x2F; outer query. EXISTS 1SELECT * FROM c WHERE EXISTS (SELECT id FROM I WHERE c_id = c.c_id) EXISTS keyword has advantage against the ‘IN (sub-query)’ manner. This is because the ‘IN (sub-query)’ needs to finish the sub-query first before the sub-query can return any result to the outer query. However, EXISTS can work as a short-circuiting operator which stops immediately when the first results is found. Write Sub-query in SELECT &#x2F; FROM clause Use SELECT to duplicate the result of aggregate function 1SELECT (SELECT AVG() FROM t) AS average FROM t; This query makes sense because, the aggregate function would only return one single value. If you want to conduct row-wise calculation on the aggregate value, you have to duplicate it. You can also SELECT FROM a sub-query like it is a real-table. However, an alias is required. This may make the query too complicated and should be used with care.
